# MetaQNN
MetaQNN is a reproducible research repo accompanying our paper on configuration-aware meta-learning for Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). It contains datasets, QNN configuration definitions, experimental pipelines, and the meta-model code used to learn performance predictors over ansatz, feature maps, optimizers, and circuit depth.
